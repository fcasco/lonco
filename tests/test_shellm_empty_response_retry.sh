# tests/test_shellm_empty_response_retry.sh — call_llm only fails the call
# when llm actually failed.
#
# Usage: tests/test_shellm_empty_response_retry.sh
#
# `llm --thinking` streams the model's reasoning to stderr and, when the
# token budget runs out during that reasoning, returns 200 with no visible
# text and exits 0. run_loop's empty-response retry exists for exactly that
# case (feed the captured thinking back as assistant context and continue),
# so call_llm must hand it back an empty response instead of dying on the
# thinking text. A real failure — llm exiting non-zero — must still die.
#
# Live-provider check (2026-08-29, OpenRouter, openrouter/free and
# gpt-oss-120b): with the budget exhausted during reasoning, non-streaming
# calls return exit 0 with empty stdout, so the retry is reachable. On
# call_llm's actual streaming path it depends on whether any reasoning
# delta streamed before truncation: if yes, mark_emitted lets llm exit 0
# with the thinking on stderr (the case this retry feeds back); if nothing
# streamed, llm's own empty-stream guard retries 3x and exits non-zero,
# and call_llm correctly dies before the retry.
#
# call_llm is extracted from bin/shellm and exercised directly (sourcing the
# whole script would run it) against a stub `llm` on PATH.
