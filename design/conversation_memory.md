# Conversation memory for the responder

Status: IN PROGRESS. Plan agreed 2026-09-02. Part 6 (metrics) shipped as
883339f and was deployed to Audel the same day. Experiments B and C both
ran on 2026-09-02; B passed and C changed the plan (see the experiment
sections and the revised rollout order). Parts 1 and 2 are built and
tested (`bin/chat`, `thinkers/responder/step`,
`tests/test_chat_history_index.sh`), pending push and deploy. Part 3 is
built and tested (`thinkers/_lib/common.sh`,
`tests/test_recent_stream_filter.sh`), pending push and deploy. Parts 5
and 4 are built and tested the same day (`thinkers/responder/step`,
`thinkers/monolith/step`, `thinkers/monolith/prompt.md`, `bin/chat`,
`tests/test_responder_deferral.sh`, `tests/test_responder_person_notes.sh`),
pending the Experiment C rerun and the push. Everything ships in one
deploy with a thinker sync of `responder`, `monolith`, and `_lib`.

Related: [responder_thinker.md](responder_thinker.md) describes the thinker
this plan changes. [monolith_thinker.md](monolith_thinker.md) and
[monolith_run_health.md](monolith_run_health.md) cover the recent stream
filter the monolith shares with it. [tiered_memory.md](tiered_memory.md) is
the long term memory the monolith has and the responder does not.

## The problem

The agent forgets a conversation within minutes. On 2026-09-01 Andy sent
"sure!" to his identity cleo about three hours after cleo had asked him a
question. Cleo replied "I'll check the last few messages so I know what
you're saying yes to." Cleo had no context for the conversation, and it also
had no way to check anything, because the responder runs without tools.

The same thing happens on Audel every day. The examples below are real
replies Audel sent after a gap of one to six hours since the previous
exchange with that person.

- Andy asked how the Telegram bridge work was going. Audel had
  been doing that work. Audel replied "Honestly nothing recent from me, I've
  been idle."
- Andy said an image file he had been expecting never arrived. Audel had
  sent that image four hours earlier. Audel replied "Ah, did it never come
  through? It went out on my end."
- Andy said "great! can you paste it into the top level of this channel?"
  three hours after Audel reviewed a launch draft for him. No reply was
  recorded at all.

## Why it happens

The responder builds the chat history from the recent stream. The function
`_recent_stream` in `thinkers/_lib/common.sh` takes the last 5,000 raw lines
of the trajectory, keeps eight step types (thought, action, observation,
message, idle, merge, final, reasoning), and returns the last 30 of them
(`THINK_CONTEXT_TAIL`, 20 by default and 30 under the dispatcher). The
responder then keeps only the messages between the identity and the sender,
capped at 12. There is no time window, no tiered memory, and no memory
lookup.

The window is measured in steps, not time, so conversational memory shrinks
whenever the mind is busy. On Audel the 30 steps before an inbound message
are on average 50 percent `reasoning` steps, 15 percent monolith `idle`
steps, 8 percent `final` steps, and 14 percent messages. Each monolith run
under Grok writes about 5.6 reasoning steps plus one final, so three or four
quiet wakes push every message out of the window. The reasoning and final
types were added to the filter on 2026-07-07, before the responder existed.
Nobody chose them for a chat context.

Two other parts of the design make it worse.

- A transport encodes the sender into the routing name exactly one way.
  The Telegram bridge writes `telegram-<user id>-<chat id>`, the phone
  chat writes `pwa-<name>`, and a plain `chat send` uses a plain name.
  There is no thread axis today (`thread_key` returns empty), so the
  same person is the same `from` everywhere and the responder already
  sees their whole conversation.
- The responder has no tools. When it says "I'm on it", nothing is
  obligated to follow. The monolith only sees an observation reading
  "Replied to Andy: I'll check...", and its prompt tells it never to reply.

The bridges are not the cause. Telegram, the phone chat, and plain `chat`
sends all append a plain message step, and the responder reads the same log
for all of them.

## Measurements

The responder does not log its prompt, so the numbers below come from a
reconstruction. I took the last 60,000 raw lines of Audel's trajectory,
which cover 17 days and 402 real inbound messages, and re-ran the
responder's exact selection logic over them. For each inbound message I
counted how many earlier messages with that sender would have been in its
window. Six real cases in the one to six hour row were checked by hand
against the replies Audel sent, and all six matched.

The first table is a failure rate. Each row groups inbound messages by how
long it had been since the previous message exchanged with that sender. Each
percentage is the share of those messages where the responder had no earlier
message with that person in its prompt at all, so it was answering with no
memory of the conversation. 0% is the good outcome and means every message
in that row had at least one earlier message available. 100% means the
responder had nothing for every message in that row. The three percentage
columns are the same reconstruction run with three different ways of
building the context.

| Gap since last exchange | Inbound messages | Forgot, with today's filter | Forgot, if reasoning, final, and idle steps are dropped | Forgot, with a messages only 7 day window |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| under 2 min | 162 | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| 2 to 15 min | 107 | 7% | 0% | 0% |
| 15 to 60 min | 30 | 80% | 13% | 0% |
| 1 to 6 hours | 36 | 100% | 36% | 0% |
| 6 to 48 hours | 19 | 100% | 68% | 0% |

The second table shows how much history was available in the typical case,
as the median number of earlier messages with that person in the prompt. The
responder caps the conversation at 12 messages, so 12 is the most it can
have.

| Gap since last exchange | Today's filter | Reasoning, final, and idle dropped | Messages only 7 day window |
|---|---|---|---|
| under 2 min | 3 | 5 | 12 |
| 2 to 15 min | 4 | 12 | 12 |
| 15 to 60 min | 0 | 7 | 12 |
| 1 to 6 hours | 0 | 2.5 | 12 |
| 6 to 48 hours | 0 | 0 | 12 |

Read together, the tables say that today the responder has a few messages
of history only while a conversation is actively going, and nothing once
the person steps away for more than 15 minutes. Dropping the noisy step
types helps but still loses the conversation within a few hours. A messages
only history with a time window gives the responder the full 12 messages in
every case measured. Another way to state the same thing is that a reply
Audel sends stays visible to the responder for a median of 16 minutes with
today's filter and 105 minutes with the noisy types dropped, while with the
messages only window it stays visible for the whole 7 days.

The read cost was measured on the box on 2026-09-02. The trajectory was
1,322 MB and 107,637 lines.

| Read strategy | Data read | Wall time |
|---|---|---|
| Today, tail 5,000 lines then jq | 62 MB | 1.3 s |
| Widen the tail to 25,000 lines for a 7 day window | 270 MB | 4.9 s |
| grep for message lines over the whole file, page cached | 1,322 MB | 0.6 s |
| A messages only index, all 1,716 messages ever | 1.3 MB | milliseconds |

Widening the tail is the wrong fix. It repeats the 2026-08-11 context build
bottleneck and gets slower as the mind writes more. The grep is fast only
while the file is in the page cache, which the 2026-08-13 memory incident
showed is not dependable. The index is the answer.

## The plan

The work is six parts. Parts 1 to 3 fix the forgetting. Parts 4 and 5
improve on it. Part 6 makes the problem visible so it cannot return quietly.
Each part can ship on its own.

### Part 1. Messages only history from a derived index

Add `chat history --with <person> [--since <duration>] [-n N]` to
`bin/chat`. It reads from an index file, `messages.jsonl`, kept next to the
trajectory, plus a byte offset file. The trajectory stays the only source of
truth. The index is derived, rebuildable, and disposable.

The index maintains itself on read, so nothing that writes message steps has
to change.

- On each call, `chat history` reads the trajectory from the saved byte
  offset to the end of the file, appends any message lines it finds to the
  index, and saves the new offset. The trajectory is append only, so the
  offset is stable and the new bytes are usually a few MB.
- If the index or offset file is missing, or the trajectory header step no
  longer matches the one recorded in the index, it rebuilds from a full
  scan. On Audel that is about 10 seconds, once.
- Two responders racing can append duplicate lines. Reads deduplicate by
  step id, so duplicates are harmless.

The responder then calls `chat history --with <person> --since 7d -n 20` in
place of the message filter over `_recent_stream`.

Experiment C added a requirement. Each history message must carry its age,
e.g. "[6 days ago]", and the system prompt must state the current time.
Without them both new prompts described a six day old exchange as "this
morning". The message steps have timestamps, so this is formatting only. The inner life excerpt
(the last 8 non message steps) stays as it is until Part 3 changes the
filter.

For agents we do not control, the first responder call after the code
update builds the index and every call after that takes milliseconds. A
stale or corrupt index can only cost a rebuild, never a wrong answer. The
index also catches messages Audel appends with raw `traj append`, which a
hook inside `chat send` would miss.

Files touched: `bin/chat`, `thinkers/responder/step`, a new test under
`tests/`.

As built: `chat history --with <name> [--since 7d] [-n N] [--json]`. The
index is `messages.jsonl` beside the trajectory with a `.offset` file that
records the consumed byte count and the trajectory header id; a header
mismatch or a missing index triggers a rebuild. Only complete lines are
consumed, so a line still being written waits for the next call. A
directory lock keeps to one updater at a time and a concurrent reader
just uses what is there. Indexed content is capped at 8,000 characters.
The responder asks for `--since 7d -n 20` (env `RESPONDER_HISTORY_SINCE`
and `RESPONDER_HISTORY_MAX`), prefixes each of the person's messages with
its age, states the current time in the system prompt, and records
`history_source` ("index" or "window") on its decision observation. When
the index returns nothing for the person it falls back to the old window
filter.

### Part 2. Person identity separate from routing identity

The `from` field stays the routing name, because the bridges need it to
deliver the reply. A new helper, `person_key`, maps a routing name to a
stable person key with no configuration.

| Routing name | Person key |
|---|---|
| telegram-8525624593-8525624593 | telegram:8525624593 |
| pwa-andy | pwa:andy |
| Andy | Andy |

`chat history --with` accepts either a routing name or a person key and
groups by person key. The responder passes the trigger's `from`, gets the
whole person's history back, and still replies to the trigger's `from`.
The split that remains is a human who uses both the phone chat and
Telegram: `pwa-andy` and `telegram-…` are two routing names for one
person, and without the person key their history is split too.

Linking the same human across channels is a second layer. The person
memory file from Part 4 gets an `aliases` list in its frontmatter, and
`chat history` merges every key listed there. The list can be filled three
ways, and unlinked aliases fall back to the first layer.

- The Telegram bridge renders the sender's profile name into the inbound
  message text; stamping a `display_name` field on the step instead would
  give a cheap link to a phone chat name like pwa-andy.
- The agent learns it. When someone says "this is Andy" on the
  phone chat, the monolith's `learn` function adds the alias.
- For Audel, Nick can write the aliases by hand.

Files touched: a helper in `bin/chat` or `thinkers/_lib/common.sh`, the
Telegram bridge for `display_name`, `thinkers/responder/step`.

Thread context, added the same day after review, but currently inert.
History by person alone misses what other people said in the same channel
thread, which is the conversation a sender is replying into. A thread key
was to be the second pure function of the routing name — channel plus
thread timestamp — with `chat history --thread <name>` returning every
message in that thread from anyone, and `--with` plus `--thread` the
de-duplicated union. No transport produces channel threads today, so
`thread_key` returns empty, the flag adds nothing, and the responder's
thread fill (`RESPONDER_THREAD_SINCE`, the speaker-stamping bridge header,
the `thread_msgs` observation) stays dormant until one does.
`tests/test_responder_thread_context.sh` covers it.

As built: `chat person-key <name>` and the same rule inside the index
filter. `chat history --with` accepts a routing name or a person key and
merges the `aliases` of any `type: person` memory whose `person_key`
matches or whose aliases list the key. The `display_name` stamp is
deferred to Part 4, which is when aliases start to matter.

### Part 3. A cleaner recent stream

Change `_recent_stream` so the responder's inner life excerpt and the
monolith's recent stream stop drowning in run scaffolding. The change has
three pieces.

- Drop `reasoning` steps. They are the model's prose between bash blocks
  during a shellm run, about 5.6 per run. Keep `final`, which is one per run
  and states what the run concluded, so the monolith still sees what its
  previous runs decided.
- Collapse a run of consecutive `idle` steps into one synthetic line with a
  count and duration, e.g. "idle x22 over 2h10m". Idle streaks are how the
  monolith knows time has passed, so they should stay visible but take one
  line, not 22.
- Add `error` steps to the filter, collapsed the same way. Today the mind
  never sees its own failed runs, which is already on the open items list.

The monolith is the only other caller. Its pacing and work probe read the
raw tail directly, so backoff is unaffected. Two of its routing hints will
fire differently. The "last three steps are all thoughts" hint will fire
more often because reasoning and idle lines no longer split up thought runs,
and the "last step is an action with no observation" hint is unchanged. The
monolith's prompt shrinks by roughly 22,000 characters per wake.

This part ships only after Experiment B below passes.

Files touched: `thinkers/_lib/common.sh`, `tests/`.

As built (2026-09-02, after Experiment B passed): `_recent_stream` keeps
thought, action, observation, message, idle, merge, final, and error
steps, drops reasoning, truncates content at 1,500 characters, takes the
last N kept steps, and then collapses consecutive idle steps and
consecutive error steps into one line each. The collapsed line reads
"idle x22 over 2h10m" or "run failed x5 over 40m (rc=1)", carries the
last step's id and timestamp, and has a `collapsed` count. The window N
bounds the raw steps considered, so the output is at most N lines and
usually fewer. That matches the transform the replay tested. Reaches
Audel with a thinker sync of `_lib`; the monolith and responder both read
it on their next wake.

### Part 4. A rolling summary of each person

Give the responder a short summary of who it is talking to. The summary
lives in `memories/` as one file per person key with `type: person` in the
frontmatter. That reuses `mem` as it is, shows on the dash memories page,
and lets the monolith's recall and learn functions read and edit it with no
new tooling.

The responder writes it. After a reply is sent, the responder starts a
background `llm` call on a cheap model (`RECAP_MAP_MODEL`, the same model
the recap rollups use) that rewrites the person file from the previous
summary plus the last few exchanges. The call runs after the send, so the
human sees no extra latency, and it happens on every reply rather than
depending on the monolith choosing to do it.

The responder reads it. The system prompt gets a block, "What you know about
this person", above the conversation. The monolith gets the same file
through its normal recall.

I considered extending `recap` instead. It rolls up by trajectory position,
and per person threads are too sparse for that to fit.

Experiment C found that the summary changes tone as well as recall. In 2 of
22 cases the summary condition refused things the other conditions agreed
to, because one old refusal in the summary was read as a standing policy.
The summary prompt needs a facts only rule that forbids inferring a stance
from a single incident, and Part 4 waits until a rerun of the saved 22
cases shows the refusals gone.

Files touched: `thinkers/responder/step`, `bin/mem` only if the person type
needs anything new.

As built: the notes live in `memories/` as `type: person` files in mem's
own naming and frontmatter, plus `person_key` and `aliases`. The responder
writes them itself rather than through `mem update`, which would drop the
extra fields; `mem list`, `search`, and `show` read them fine. The writer
runs after the send in a background subshell (foreground with
`RESPONDER_PERSON_NOTES_SYNC=1` for tests), on `RESPONDER_NOTES_MODEL`,
falling back to `RECAP_MAP_MODEL`, then the reply model. It feeds the
model the previous notes plus the last 30 days of conversation with that
person, keeps a directory lock so one writer runs at a time, redacts key
shaped strings, caps the body at 20 lines, and rewrites the existing file
in place keeping id, created, and aliases. The system prompt is the facts
only rule from Experiment C in full: facts and stated preferences only,
never turn one incident into a rule or a stance, do not record refusals.
The reader puts the body into the responder's system prompt under "What
you know about <person>" with a note not to treat one past incident as a
rule. `RESPONDER_PERSON_NOTES=0` turns both off. The `display_name`
stamp for seeding aliases is still open.

### Part 5. Deferrals that the monolith must pick up

When the responder decides it cannot answer without doing work, it says
"I'm on it" today and appends nothing that binds anyone. Change it so that
in that case it appends an `action` step describing the work, e.g. "Andy
asked whether the bridge work is done. Check and report back." The monolith
already has a routing hint for an action with no observation, so the work
gets routed on the next wake. The monolith is then allowed to `chat reply`
to the trigger, but only when a pending action from the responder exists
for it, which keeps the rule that the monolith does not answer chat on its
own. The responder's prompt should also stop promising to "check" things,
since it cannot.

Files touched: `thinkers/responder/step`, `thinkers/monolith/prompt.md`,
`thinkers/monolith/step` for the permission check.

As built: the responder's prompt now says that when a real answer needs
tools or a lookup it must put `DEFER: <the work>` on the first line and
the holding message below it, and must not promise to check anything
itself. On a DEFER line the step appends an `action` step (source
responder, `trigger_step`, `person`, `request`, and the exact delivery
command in its content) before sending the holding message, and marks its
observation `deferred: true` with the request. The monolith already
subscribes to actions, so it wakes; its step adds a "PENDING REQUEST"
routing signal for every responder action that no observation has
resolved, oldest first with its age, naming the person, the request, and
the exact commands. The list comes from `chat pending`, which reads a
`deferrals.jsonl` index kept beside `messages.jsonl` in the same pass, so
a request stays visible however many steps or newer requests land on top
of it. The first version scanned the 20-step recent stream and showed only
the newest request; on 2026-09-02 Nick's request was masked by a newer one
from Braden, then aged out of the window before the mind's runs (which
were dying on a model timeout that afternoon) delivered it. Requests
older than four hours are marked overdue in the hint; older than 14 days
they are dropped from it (`MONOLITH_PENDING_MAX_AGE`), though `chat
pending` still lists them. After the deploy on 2026-09-03 two timer wakes
in a row saw the hint and filed research notes instead, following Audel's
own "timer wakeups are for inner life" rule. The prompt now says a
pending request outranks the menu on any wake and to strongly prefer
acting on it, with one escape hatch: a good reason, stated in a thought
with what would unblock it. Silence is no longer an option. Its
prompt gains one exception to the no-reply rule: deliver such a request
with `chat reply --follow-up --reply-to <trigger> <person>` and append an
observation with `--field resolves=<trigger>`, one delivery per request.
`chat reply --follow-up` stamps `reply_to` and `follow_up: true` and skips
the duplicate guard, which exists for races, not for follow-ups. A plain
second reply is still refused.

### Part 6. Metrics, so the problem stays visible

Add fields to the responder's existing "Replied" and "no-reply"
observations. Each is a few bytes.

- `context_msgs`, the number of earlier messages with this person the
  responder had in its prompt.
- `gap_s`, seconds since the previous exchange with this person.
- `compose_ms`, time from wake to send.
- `model`, the model used.
- `context_steps`, the list of step ids that made up the conversation and
  the inner life excerpt. The ids are a few hundred bytes and let anyone
  rebuild the exact prompt from the trajectory later.

The full prompt text is not recorded. The identity and skills part is the
same on every call, and the monolith's `prompt` steps are already why the
trajectory is 91 percent repetition. For debugging, an env flag
`RESPONDER_LOG_PROMPT=1` writes the prompt to a rotated file under
`run/logs/`, not to the mind log.

`deploy/scripts/audel-metrics` gets one more series, the share of inbound
messages with `context_msgs` equal to zero when `gap_s` is under 48 hours
and a previous exchange existed. The Usage tab can show it as a tile.

As built: `gap_s` is read from the raw 5,000 line tail after the send, so
it does not add latency and it is measured even when the filtered window
has forgotten the person. It skips the trigger's own reply and any message
with a later timestamp. When no earlier message with that person is in the
tail the field is absent, which the report counts as first contact. The
`audel-metrics` report prints the gap bucket table in the same shape as
the tables above, plus a per day "forgot" column, from these fields only.
Replies from before the deploy carry no fields and are not counted.

## Experiments

### Experiment A. Reconstruction baseline, done

The reconstruction scripts used for the tables above live in the private
experiments repo at `headlong-experiments/responder-memory/`. They should
be re-run once after Parts 1 and 2 deploy to
confirm the zero context share drops to zero for every gap under 7 days.
After Part 6 ships the real `context_msgs` field replaces the
reconstruction.

### Experiment B. Replay of the recent stream change, done, passed

Ran 2026-09-02 in the private replay harness. 30 new Grok 4.6 trials cost
$1.83. The control arm reused the 10 baseline runs from 08-28 plus 5 new
per snapshot. The third snapshot during an active conversation was skipped
because capturing it needs temp files on the box.

| Snapshot | Arm | Idle | Thought only | Substantive | Mean turns | Prompt chars |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| s4-idle | control | 9 | 1 | 0 | 2.0 | 73,125 |
| s4-idle | part 3 | 8 | 2 | 0 | 1.1 | 38,657 |
| s5-reread | control | 8 | 2 | 0 | 1.0 | 102,426 |
| s5-reread | part 3 | 8 | 2 | 0 | 1.0 | 64,297 |

Same outcome classes in both arms on both snapshots. Hand review of all 20
filtered transcripts found no run that referred to or needed anything that
was only in the dropped reasoning lines. On s4, 8 of 10 controls opened by
copying a caption verbatim from a dropped reasoning line and then ran a
chat history check for 2 to 4 turns; 0 of 10 filtered runs did either. The
reasoning lines were being copied as a ritual, not used as information.
The prompt shrank 47 percent on s4 and 37 percent on s5. Verdict: pass.
Part 3 can ship. Two things to watch live afterward: a wake during an
active conversation, where the circling hint may fire more, and a multi
hour idle streak, since the snapshots only had idle pairs minutes apart.
Results: `results/recent-stream-filter-20260902.md` in the harness.

The original plan for the experiment follows.

The 2026-08-29 ablations showed that Grok's behavior on the monolith
depends on accumulated prompt state in ways that are hard to predict, so
the filter change gets a controlled replay before it touches Audel. Use the
private replay harness at
`~/laude/repos/headlong-experiments/audel-proactivity/controlled-replay/`.

- Conditions. The current filter, and the Part 3 filter (no reasoning,
  collapsed idle and error, final kept).
- Snapshots. The two existing late Audel snapshots, plus one taken during
  an active conversation so the change to the circling hint is exercised.
- Trials. 10 per condition per snapshot, 60 total, Grok 4.6. Budget under
  $5. The 08-29 batches of 10 to 40 trials cost $0.63 to $4.40.
- What to measure. Function chosen, whether the run produced a durable
  step, prompt size in characters, and whether the run referred to
  something only visible in reasoning steps under the old filter. That last
  item is the risk, and it is checked by hand.
- Pass condition. The Part 3 filter is no worse on productive wakes and
  saved results, and no run loses a decision it needed from a dropped
  reasoning step.

### Experiment C. Responder quality, done, changed the plan

Ran 2026-09-02. 22 cases, not 30, because only 22 inbound messages in the
last 17 days arrived more than an hour after the previous exchange once
the codex and Telegram bot senders were excluded. In all 22 today's window
held zero earlier messages. 88 calls cost $0.67. One scorer, one sample per
condition. The skills layer was absent in all three conditions because
`skills prompt` returned nothing on the box.

| Condition | Aware of the earlier exchange, of 11 where it applied | Promises work it cannot do, of 22 | Wrong about visible facts, of 22 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Today's prompt | 0 | 6 | 3 |
| Part 1 history | 7 | 9 | 2 |
| Part 1 plus person summary | 9 | 6 | 1 |

Findings. Both new conditions misread time because the history has no
timestamps and the prompt has no current time (now a Part 1 requirement).
The summary shifted tone in 2 of 22 cases (now a Part 4 requirement).
History raised promised but impossible work from 6 to 9, because with
history the responder knows there is unfinished work and says it is
checking; that is the case for doing Part 5 early. Today's three factual
errors were cross thread mistakes, answering Andy with material from the
inner life excerpt because there was no conversation to anchor to.

Decision. Ship Part 1 with timestamps. Hold Part 4 until its summary
prompt has the facts only rule and the saved 22 cases rerun clean (a few
minutes, about 40 cents). Results and every prompt and reply:
`headlong-experiments/responder-memory/experiment-c/`.

Rerun, same day, with Part 4 as built (condition D: Part 1 history with
age stamps and current time, plus the notes block from the facts only
prompt). 44 calls, $0.33.

| Condition | Aware, of 11 | Promises work, of 22 | Wrong about visible facts, of 22 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Today's prompt | 0 | 6 | 3 |
| Part 1 history | 7 | 9 | 2 |
| Part 1 plus first summary | 9 | 6 | 1 |
| Part 1 plus Part 4 as built | 8 | 9 | 0 |

One of the two refusals is gone. The other is softened: the reply answers
the question and then adds that it will not post a log of other people's
messages, because the notes still recorded the old refusal in neutral
words. The "this morning" error is gone. Promises stayed at 9 because
the rerun deliberately left DEFER out, so they are the replies Part 5
converts. Awareness dropped one case against the first summary, where a
longer first person summary happened to lead with the specific thread.
Decision: ship Part 4 with the rest. The notes prompt gained one more
sentence, that a declined request is left out entirely, not recorded in
neutral words. Re-score the remaining case on live notes after a week.

The original plan for the experiment follows.

A cheap side by side on the responder alone, which is one `llm` call and
needs no harness. Take 30 real inbound messages from Audel's log that
arrived more than an hour after the previous exchange with that person.
For each, build the prompt three ways and generate a reply.

- Today's prompt.
- Part 1, messages only history with a 7 day window.
- Part 1 plus Part 4, with a person summary written from the log.

Score each reply by hand on whether it shows awareness of the earlier
exchange and whether it promises work it cannot do. The 90 calls cost under
a dollar on Grok. The result decides whether Part 4 ships with Part 1 or
later.

### Experiment D. Live measurement after deploy

For two weeks after Parts 1, 2, and 6 are live on Audel, read the new
`context_msgs` field. Report the zero context share per gap bucket in the
same table shape as above. Also count replies that contain "I'll check" or
"let me look" while no action step was appended, which is the deferral
problem Part 5 addresses.

## Rollout order

Revised 2026-09-02 after Experiments B and C.

1. Part 6. Done and deployed.
2. Parts 1 and 2 together, with the timestamp requirement from Experiment
   C. Re-run Experiment A after the deploy.
3. Part 3. Experiment B passed, so it can ship next; watch the two live
   cases named in the experiment section.
4. Part 5, moved up because Experiment C showed history makes the
   responder promise more work it cannot do.
5. Part 4 last, after the summary prompt gets the facts only rule and the
   saved Experiment C cases rerun clean. Done 2026-09-02; all five parts
   ship in one deploy.

Each deploy to Audel follows the normal runbook, `update` then thinker sync
of `responder` and `_lib` from a pristine tree. `bin/chat` takes effect on
the next exec with no restart. The box tree currently carries Audel's own
uncommitted edits to `bin/chat` and `thinkers/_lib/common.sh` (file step
rendering for Telegram), so they have to be stashed around the deploy and
merged or reviewed afterward.

## What this does not cover

- The monolith forging outbound chat with `source:"responder"`. Part 5
  narrows when the monolith may reply, but the fix for forged sources is
  still open.
- Cross channel alias linking for agents without a human to seed it. The
  agent can learn aliases, but nothing forces it to.
- Any change to the tiered memory the monolith uses. The responder gets a
  per person summary, not the life summary.
